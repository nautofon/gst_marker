The [orange]Gas station underground tank markers[normal] mod adds symbols for deliverable gas stations to the world map and job market. It also appends "/gst" to the in-game company name for such gas stations, which identifies them on the F6 screen and makes them searchable in the Job Browser and the Logistics Map.

This makes delivery jobs to gas stations easier to find in the job market. It can also give a better understanding of the game economy.

[orange]Limitations:[normal]

As a side effect of this mod, green cargo job triggers will appear in the game world at deliverable gas stations. There will never be any jobs available though, because the only type of cargo provided here is not accepted anywhere. This special marker cargo also shows up on the Logistics Map.

[orange]Compatibility:[normal]

Tested with ATS 1.43 and 1.51. Likely compatible with a wide range of ATS versions.
