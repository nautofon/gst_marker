## Gas station underground tank markers

The **Gas station underground tank markers** mod adds symbols for deliverable
gas stations to the world map and job market in
[ATS](https://americantrucksimulator.com/). It also appends "/gst" to the
in-game company name for such gas stations. This identifies them on the F6
screen and makes them searchable in the Job Browser and the Logistics Map
(formerly known as Company Browser). The company logo symbols for Gallon Oil
and Vortex gas stations differ from their regular company logos.

This makes delivery jobs to gas stations easier to find in the job market.
It can also give a better understanding of the game economy.

### Limitations

*	As a side effect of this mod, green cargo job triggers will appear
	in the game world at deliverable gas stations.
	There will never be any jobs available though, because the only type
	of cargo provided here is not accepted anywhere.
	This special marker cargo also shows up on the Logistics Map.

*	The graphical style of the company logo symbols is not yet updated
	to the current game version.
